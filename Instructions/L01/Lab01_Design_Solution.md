# Process Advisor & Importing Solution

**⏱️ The estimated time to complete this lab is 2 hours 30 minutes.**

## Scenario

In this lab, you will be working to design the automation of a
Construction Loan Funding process that is currently manually tracked by
Relecloud staff.

## High-level lab objectives

-   Discover the current process

-   Use Process Advisor to visualize and analyze the current process

-   Evaluate automation options

-   Design the automation of the process

-   Import and review the starter solution

# Exercise \# 1 – Discover Current Process

In this exercise you are going to get to know the current manual
process.

## Task 1: Review the process scenario

The following companies or people are involved in the process you will
be automating.

| **Company or people** | **Description**                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Borrower              | Borrows money from bank to build a house.                                                                                                   |
| Builder               | Has an agreement to build house for Borrower and gets paid as the house is built by Loan Draws from the borrower’s loan.                    |
| Woodgrove Bank        | Loans borrower money to build house, hires Relecloud to manage the construction loan draw funding as the house is built by the builder.     |
| Relecloud             | Escrow company that manages the process for the bank. They do all the manual work today and this is who you are automating the process for. |
| Fabrikam Inspections  | An inspection company that goes on site to verify and provide proof of work completed.                                                      |
| A Datum               | A risk management company that helps banks reduce losses from bad loans. They provide a risk score used in the process.                     |

The following describes the current manual process:

Woodgrove Bank does construction loans to builders to build homes.
Woodgrove does not give all the loan money to the builders on initial
approval they only give it as construction progresses. Each month,
builders can request loan funds (a draw) for the progress made and funds
spent during the last month.

Woodgrove is too busy to manage the process, so they hired Relecloud to
manage it. Each month builders email forms requesting funds to
Relecloud. After review, Relecloud requests Fabrikam Inspections via
their website to do an onsite inspection to verify the work stated was
actually done.

Once the inspection is completed, Relecloud does a risk check using a
website A Datum has that confirm that the builder hasn’t become high
risk. After these checks, Relecloud uses a Windows form app provided by
Woodgrove to request funding. Someone from Relecloud checks the app each
day for any completed requests and then they notify of funding
completed.

Today Relecloud does each process step manually. You have been asked if
you can improve the process by automating some of the process.

## Task 2: Review the draw request form

1.  Go to the lab resources folder and open the Draw1-MC3747.pdf file.

2.  Review the form.

3.  This form is completed for each draw by the builder and emailed to
    Relecloud.

## Task 3: Review the loan tracking Excel file

1.  Go to the lab resources folder and open the LoanTracking-MC3747.xlsx
    file.

2.  Review the loan tracking file.

3.  Relecloud staff creates one of these worksheet files for each loan
    and uses it to track the draws on the loan.

# Exercise \# 2 – Use Process Advisor with Data

In this exercise, you will create a process advisor from existing
process data and review the analytics.

# Exercise \# 4 – Evaluate Automation Options

When you automate a process, you want to use the most efficient and
reliable means of automation possible. In this exercise you will
re-review what you know about the process and what should be automating
an app and what should use an API.

## Task 1: Review and make notes of what should use an app and what should be a connector

A discovery process has been completed by the project team. The following
is the original scenario with our notes from the discovery added.

Woodgrove Bank does construction loans to builders to build homes.
Woodgrove does not give all the loan money to the builders on initial
approval they only give it as construction progresses. Each month,
builders can request loan funds (a draw) for the progress made and funds
spent during the last month.

Woodgrove is too busy to manage the process, so they hired Relecloud to
manage it. Each month builders email forms requesting funds to
Relecloud. After review, Relecloud requests Fabrikam Inspections via
their website to do an onsite inspection to verify the work stated was
actually done. *During discovery we learned that Fabrikam has no plans to
offer an API*.

Once the inspection is completed, Relecloud does a risk check using a
website A Datum has that confirm that the builder hasn’t become high
risk. *During discovery we learned A Datum has a RESTful API for the risk
check*.

After these checks, Relecloud uses a Windows form app provided by
Woodgrove to request funding. Someone from Relecloud checks the app each
day for any completed requests and then they notify of funding
completed. *During discovery we learned that Woodgrove plans to modernize
the app in the future*.

Today Relecloud does each process step manually. You have been asked if
you can improve the process by automating some of the process.


# Exercise \# 5 – Design the automation

In this exercise, you will review the design the team came up with. In
the rest of this course, you will be building out this automation.

## Task 1 – Review the process diagram

<img src="../L01/media/image39.png" style="width:6.5in;height:1.09792in"
alt="process diagram" />

## Task 2 – Review design notes

-   A shared mailbox will be used to not be dependent on individual users

-   Dataverse tables will be used instead of Excel worksheets to track
    the process. There will be a Loan, Loan Draw and Inspection Photo
    tables.

-   Child flows will be used for Lookup, Inspection and Funding to keep
    the main cloud flow maintainable.

-   Inspection website will be automated with an unattended desktop flow
    which will include a JSON array of work site photos.

-   The inspection child flow will run the inspection desktop flow and
    then download and persist the work site photos to the Dataverse
    table.

-   A custom connector will be built for A Datum’s Risk API.

-   The Woodgrove Funding Manager Windows app will be automated with a
    desktop flow.

# Exercise \# 6 – Import starting solution
